1-Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf? 
a2 holds 13 and a1 holds 12 so all the as from a0 to a7 and from fa0 to fa7 that stores the function arguments in code a0, a1, a2



2-Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.) 
f was directly optimized during compilation and loaded in a1, that goes for the g as well as it they are inline functions

3-At what address is the function printf located? 
aupic makes the pc+immidiate besides ra which is zeros and shifts it left by 12 and then put it all in ra
jalr jumps to the return address which is 1552+ra which is 0x610+0x30=0x640


4-What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main? 
pc+4 to be able to return back to the original that is 34+4=38

5-HE110 World, bigendian 0x726c6400 , we don't need to change the integer 

6-every time the y will give a different number because i didn't give him a specific number to be printed so it prints the number given in a2
